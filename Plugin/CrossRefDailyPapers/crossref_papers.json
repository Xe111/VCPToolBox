    "abstract": "The Histopathologic Oral Cancer Detection Dataset, which consists of meticulously annotated high-resolution histopathological images, is an essential resource for advancing the early diagnosis and classification of oral cancer. The dataset, categorized into \"Normal\" and \"Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC)\" classes, underpins the development and evaluation of sophisticated deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to distinguish between malignant and non-malignant tissue samples. In this study, the efficacy of the ResNet50 deep learning architecture was rigorously evaluated for its ability to classify histopathological images of oral cancer. Two methodologies were investigated: initially, ResNet50 was applied as an independent classifier, achieving a Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Accuracy of 97.43%, alongside an MCC of 94.86 and an AUC of 97.43%. Subsequently, the study incorporated Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) during the pre-processing phase, a technique well-regarded for enhancing image contrast adaptively, particularly in medical imaging contexts. The integration of CLAHE resulted in a marked improvement in performance, with the model attaining a Precision of 98.37%, Recall of 98.33%, F1 Score of 98.33%, Accuracy of 98.33%, MCC of 96.70%, and AUC of 98.37%. These results emphasized the importance of CLAHE. It is very useful for early diagnosis of oral cancer.",

Simultaneously, these advances are revealing how much more there is to learn. At the 2024 virtual retreat of the Molecular Biology and Physiology (MBP) Community of the Council on Microbial Sciences (COMS) of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), eight early-career investigators, along with retreat attendees, discussed some of these astounding advances, as well as the challenges and opportunities the developments raise. Motivated by these discussions, we review the state-of-the-art in molecular microbiology and provide an outlook on this field. Our hope is that the topics discussed here can serve as an inspiration for the development of future technologies, resources, and guidelines and for the training of the next generation of microbiologists.",

We present a hybrid deep-learning architecture of classification (CNN) and\nobject detection (YOLOv3) to screen microscopic images and medical scans to detect these diseases.

We further incorporate\nhybrid classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Deep Neural Networks) on convolutional features to enhance accuracy. Using public\nblood-cell datasets (e.g. BCCD and ErythrocytesIDB) and simulated clinical CF scans, our results exhibit high accuracy (&gt;98%)\nto distinguish sickled vs. normal red blood cells. Embedded device implementations (e.g. smartphone or Raspberry Pi\nmicroscopes) are demonstrated for cost-effective deployment.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTSoil microbial biodiversity plays a fundamental role in regulating dryland ecosystem multifunctionality, being influenced by various environmental factors, particularly plant cover and soil properties. However, the complex interactions among soil microbial communities, plant communities, and soil physicochemical properties in desert steppe ecosystems remain inadequately understood. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the relationships between aboveground plant communities and soil environmental parameters (including nitrate nitrogen, pH, cation exchange capacity, and effective phosphorus) and their influence on the diversity and community structure of soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi across 37 desert steppe sites in Bayannur, Inner Mongolia, a typical northern China's dryland region. Our results showed that bacterial diversity exhibited significant variation among plant communities, with notably higher diversity in Stipa breviflora‐dominated soils compared to Peganum harmala‐dominated soils. The microbial communities were characterized by dominant phyla: Acidobacteriota (21.5%) in bacteria, Crenarchaeota (97.3%) in archaea, and Ascomycota (82.1%) in fungi. Bacterial diversity was significantly correlated with soil pH, available potassium, and carbonate content, while archaeal diversity showed strong correlations with ammonium nitrogen, available phosphorus, carbonate content, and cation exchange capacity. Fungal diversity, however, exhibited significant correlation only with available phosphorus. Environmental factors explained varying degrees of community structure variations, with the highest explanatory power for archaea (66.1%), followed by bacteria (49.0%) and fungi (32.8%). Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that plant communities influenced bacterial communities primarily through modifications in soil pH and ion contents. These findings underscore the critical role of plant communities and soil properties in shaping soil microbial diversity patterns. Given the essential function of biodiversity in ecosystem processes, our findings propose that soil bacterial diversity that was sensitive to vegetation shifts and closely linked to soil nutrient dynamics serves as a valuable bioindicator for monitoring and assessing degradation in desert steppe ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the long-term groundwater level measurement method and three-month groundwater level fluctuation characteristics in the coastal landfill were conducted. The long-term groundwater measurement system consists of a lower cap, non-porous pipe, strainer, and protection box, and a pressure-type water level gauge (TD Diver) with its own built-in battery is recommended. As a result of long-term groundwater level measurements at coastal landfill sites in the same area, there was significant variation in groundwater levels due to topographical or geological factors, tide, rainfall, and landfill materials or existed underground structures. The effect of tide level is different for each location, and that is not significant if it is located very close to the coast. Rising water levels were observed at all sites following rainfall. However, the amount of increase in groundwater level and the rate of rise and fall over time differ greatly for each site. Since the groundwater level is an important factor related to water leakage in the earth retaining wall and impervious barrier of coastal landfills, we recommend measurements for at least three months, equivalent to one quarter, and a design that reflects this.",

    "authors": "Gabriel Marín Díaz",
    "issuedDate": "2025-6-30",
    "abstract": "This article presents an interpretable framework for customer segmentation and churn risk detection, integrating fuzzy clustering, explainable AI (XAI), and strategic scoring. The process begins with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) applied to normalized RFM indicators (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), which were then mapped to a 2-tuple linguistic scale to enhance semantic interpretability. Cluster memberships and centroids were analyzed to identify distinct behavioral patterns. An XGBoost classifier was trained to validate the coherence of the fuzzy segments, while SHAP and LIME provided global and local explanations for the classification decisions. Following segmentation, an AHP-based strategic score was computed for each customer, using weights derived from pairwise comparisons reflecting organizational priorities. These scores were also translated into the 2-tuple domain, reinforcing interpretability. The model then identified customers at risk of disengagement, defined by a combination of low Recency, high Frequency and Monetary values, and a low AHP score. Based on Recency thresholds, customers are classified as Active, Latent, or Probable Churn. A second XGBoost model was applied to predict this risk level, with SHAP used to explain its predictive behavior. Overall, the proposed framework integrated fuzzy logic, semantic representation, and explainable AI to support actionable, transparent, and human-centered customer analytics.",

The high-dimensional, dynamic, and non-stationary characteristics of network traffic data pose significant challenges to traditional feature optimization methods. This study investigates a strategic framework integrating Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI) and Pearson correlation coefficients for DDoS attack detection, aiming to explore its potential in optimizing network intrusion datasets. Experimental evaluations using common machine learning models demonstrate that the VMD-based framework enhances detection accuracy, achieving approximately 7% performance gain across optimal model configurations. Notably, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method attained the highest detection accuracy of 99.55%. These findings preliminarily validate the effectiveness of the VMD-based framework in processing non-stationary network data.",

More specifically, the necessity for robust detection systems is outlined, a predefined list of banned terms is combined to embed techniques for similarity search, and a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representa- tions from Transformers) model is built to identify and mitigate prompt injections effectively with the aim to neutralize prompt injections in real-time. The research highlights the challenges in balancing secu- rity with usability, evolving attack vectors, and LLM limitationsm, and emphasizes the significance of securing LLM-integrated applications against prompt injections to preserve data privacy, user trust, and uphold ethical standards.

Metode survei konvensional yang menggunakan kapal survei seringkali memakan waktu, tidak praktis di daerah terpencil, dan menimbulkan risiko keamanan. Studi ini mengeksplorasi pemanfaatan teknologi Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) dalam melakukan survei pendaratan amfibi, memanfaatkan kemampuannya untuk memberikan data tiga dimensi resolusi tinggi dari topografi bawah air, fitur pantai, dan hambatan. Dengan menggunakan pendekatan studi kasus kualitatif, penelitian ini mengevaluasi implementasi LIDAR dalam survei hidrografi yang dilakukan oleh Pusat Hidro-Oseanografi TNI Angkatan Laut (Pushidrosal). Data dikumpulkan melalui wawancara dengan para expert selanjutnya diolah menggunakan tools Nvivo 15 dan dianalisa menggunakan analisa SWOT untuk menilai kekuatan, kelemahan, peluang dan ancaman. Hasil penelitan menunjukkan bahwa teknologi LIDAR menawarkan keunggulan secara signifikan, antara lain akuisisi data yang lebih cepat, cakupan yang luas, dan kemampuan integrasi dengan Sistem Informasi Geografis (SIG). Namun, tantangan seperti keterbatasan keahlian sumber daya manusia, ketergantungan pada kondisi lingkungan, dan kendala infrastruktur menghambat pemanfaatannya secara optimal. Rekomendasi strategis meliputi peningkatan pelatihan personel, investasi dalam infrastruktur teknologi, dan menjalin kolaborasi dengan lembaga penelitian untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan tentang LIDAR. Analisa SWOT menyarankan strategi \"Turn Around\" dimana strategi ini berorientasi mengatasi kelemahan dan memanfaatkan peluang serta memastikan penerapan LIDAR yang efektif dalam mendukung operasi amfibi. Studi ini menyoroti potensi transformatif LIDAR dalam survei hidrografi militer modern, menekankan perlunya peningkatan kapasitas dan perencanaan strategis untuk memaksimalkan manfaatnya.",

Improving diagnostic testing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is essential to minimize unnecessary antibiotic use, which contributes to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between urine culture and three commonly used screening methods (urine microscopy, leukocyte esterase, and dipstick nitrite) for detecting UTIs. Method. A prospective observational study was conducted to assess the correlation between urine culture results and urine microscopy, leukocyte esterase, and dipstick nitrite tests. Based on clinical history, findings, and laboratory results, along with inclusion and exclusion criteria, and with parental consent, 76 children were enrolled in the study. Urine samples were collected and tested using microscopy, dipstick leukocyte esterase, and nitrite methods. Results. Of the 76 urine samples examined, 38 were culture-positive and 38 were culture-negative. The pathogens isolated included E. coli (n = 31), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 4) and Klebsiella spp. (n = 3). The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of urine microscopy were 97.37%, 18.42%, 54.41%, and 97.5% respectively; those of the urine dipstick leucocyte esterase were 76.32%, 63.16%, 72.73% and 67.44% respectively. For urine dipstick nitrite testing, the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were 39.47%, 100%, 100%, and 62.3%, respectively. When any of the three screening tests were considered positive, sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 100%. A total of 100% may be attributable to the relatively small sample size. Nonetheless, using any one of the screening tests as an indicator significantly improved sensitivity compared to using individual tests alone. Conclusion. This study highlights the benefit of combining dipstick tests (leukocyte esterase and nitrite) with urine microscopy as effective screening tools for UTIs. Employing multiple tests reduces the likelihood of missing a diagnosis, which is critical given that delayed detection of UTIs can lead to complications such as renal scarring and, in severe cases, renal failure.",

    "abstract": "In this research paper, we have investigated the dependence of power radiated, energy flux and chirp mass of\ngravitational waves on binary system and orbital decay in the space by applying the Einstein General theory of relativity based\non gravitational wave detection technique. The direct detection of gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein’s theory of General\nRelativity, marks a revolutionary advancement in our understanding of the universe. The core of this research paper examines\nthe mechanics of Laser interferometry used by LIGO to detect these minuscule distortions in space time caused by cataclysmic\nastrophysical events such as binary black hole mergers and neutron star collisions. It is found that for lower values of chirp\nmass, the decay rate is significantly less pronounced, suggesting that systems with lower masses will experience slower orbital\ndecay. Conversely, higher chirp masses lead to more rapid decay, which is critical in the context of observable gravitational\nwaves, especially for massive binary systems like black hole mergers. It has also been observed that the higher chirp masses lead\nto more rapid decay, which is critical in the context of observable gravitational waves, especially for massive binary systems like\nblack hole mergers. This research also analyzes that how gravitational waves effect other celestial bodies and also after merging\nor colliding what will going to the dynamics of that celestial bodies.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Long COVID syndrome is a major health issue. Multiple treatments have been proposed but efficacy is inadequately investigated. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been promoted based on a small number of publications. As there is potential for a placebo effect and the financial cost of HBOT is high, we sought to investigate the effects of HBOT in Long COVID in a randomised trial.\nMethods: We randomised 101 patients into four treatment groups, receiving 10 sessions of oxygen ‘treatment’ inside a pressure chamber, according to one of four modalities: A – 100% oxygen at 253 kPa (2.5 atmospheres absolute); B – 40% oxygen at 253 kPa; C – 100% oxygen at 101.3 kPa (1 atmosphere absolute); D – 21% oxygen at 101.3 kPa. Groups B and C thus received a similar effective oxygen dose of 101.3 kPa. Quality of life symptom scores (Visual Analogue Scale; EQ-5D-5L, C19-YRSm), a 6-minute walking test and five neurocognitive tests were administered before and after the treatment series. At three months post-treatment, a telephone questionnaire probed for lasting effects.\nResults: All groups were comparable with regards to demographics, Long COVID symptoms and severity. After treatment, there were no significant differences in subjective symptoms, functional scores, and cognitive performance between any groups. The response to treatment was highly variable, with some patients in even the ‘placebo’ group D reporting a significant improvement in their well-being. This was not reflected in any objective outcome scores. No subgroups of patients responded better to any of the treatments.\nConclusions: There was no significant effect from different doses of oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. It is possible that the very modest improvements reported in other studies were due to a placebo effect. Claims that HBOT has a significant effect on Long COVID need further investigation before indiscriminately prescribing or promoting HBOT.",

    "abstract": "Domestic wastewater discharge provides fundamental data for water resource management and planning processes, and can reflect regional characteristics. Accordingly, the importance of reliably predicting domestic wastewater discharge is increasing. This study analyzed the performance of deep learning-based models for predicting domestic wastewater discharge, based on sequence length and prediction horizon. To predict domestic wastewater discharge, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)-based prediction model was developed and trained on daily precipitation, water intake, and domestic wastewater discharge data. Furthermore, hyperparameter optimization was performed using the Hyperband algorithm to improve the model's performance and robustness. For the analysis of prediction performance based on sequence length and prediction horizon, combinations of input sequence lengths (7, 15, and 30 days) and prediction horizons (1 to 5 days) were configured and analyzed. The results confirmed that these factors affected the prediction of domestic wastewater discharge. Prediction performance generally decreased as the prediction horizon increased. During the validation period, the highest prediction performance occurred with a 7-day sequence length for a 1-day prediction horizon, whereas during the test period, the best performance was observed with a 30-day sequence length for a 1-day prediction horizon. This confirms the necessity of considering various sequence lengths, even for the same prediction horizon. Overall, the 7-day sequence length showed relatively effective and stable performance for longer prediction horizons, demonstrating that increasing the sequence length does not necessarily improve long-term prediction performance. The results of this study confirm the importance of carefully selecting the input sequence length when developing domestic wastewater discharge prediction models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAsthma is a heterogeneous group of diseases. The mechanism by which dysregulated circRNAs affect severe asthma by regulating macrophage polarization remains unclear.MethodsHigh-throughput RNA sequencing technology was used to analyze circRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with severe asthma. RT-qPCR and ELISA were used to analyze the expression of inflammatory factors in a mouse model of severe asthma induced by ovalbumin-lipopolysaccharide. The effect of circ-0001875 on macrophage activation and the underlying mechanism were analyzed by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA. Subsequently, the regulatory relationships among circ-0001875, miR-31-5p, and SP1 were examined through dual luciferase reporter gene assay, and the mechanism by which they regulate macrophage polarization was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsCompared with the healthy control group, 420 circRNAs were differentially expressed in PBMCs from patients with severe asthma. Among them, circ-0001875, which was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of monocytes, was significantly downregulated in asthmatics, especially those with severe disease. circ-0001875 overexpression inhibited M1 macrophage activation in vitro and alleviated lung inflammation in a mouse model of severe asthma. Mechanistically, circ-0001875 promoted SP1 translation by competitively binding to miR-31-5p, thereby reducing its inhibitory effect on SP1 translation; SP1 then inhibited M1 macrophage polarization, which is associated with severe asthma, through the NF-κB signaling pathway.ConclusionsWe found that circ-0001875 plays an important role in regulating M1 macrophage polarization, which is associated with a severe pro-inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Context. The role of mergers in the evolution of massive black holes is still unclear, and their dynamical evolution from the formation of pairs to binaries and the final coalescence carries large physical uncertainties. The identification of the elusive population of close massive binary black holes (MBBHs) is crucial to understand the importance of mergers in the formation and evolution of SMBHs.\nAims. It has been proposed that MBBHs may display periodic optical or ultraviolet variability. Optical surveys provide photometric measurements of a large variety of objects over decades, and searching for periodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical or UV light curves may help identify new MBBH candidates.\nMethods. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the long-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified using the galaxy catalogue Glade+.\nResults. We report 36 MBBH candidates, with sinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3−5 cycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected when adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the periodicities are corroborated through generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed modulation. We also indicate 58 objects that were previously proposed to be MBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows that the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a catalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the coming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBH candidates, we expect ∼20 MBBHs at z&lt;1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further observations will help confirm these results.",

This study presents the fabrication of NH3 gas sensors based on polyaniline (PANI) and Polyaniline/silver nanocomposites (PANI/Ag NCs). PANI and Ag NPs were prepared by chemical oxidation and polyol methods, while PANI/Ag NCs were prepared using an ultrasonic-assisted method. XRD analysis confirmed the crystallinity of Ag NPs and the amorphous nature of PANI. SEM images revealed the porous structure of PANI and the uniform distribution of Ag NPs within the PANI matrix. UV–Vis analysis displayed the characteristic absorbance peaks and FTIR analysis confirmed the purity of the synthesized materials. The PANI/Ag (80/20) NC sensor notably displayed significantly improved gas-sensing properties over pristine PANI in terms of higher capacitive and resistive responses, superior sensitivity up to 1047.2%, and faster response/recovery times of 20/6 sec at 36 ppm. The enhanced performance would be ascribed to the enhanced surface area with the incorporation of AgNPs and better electron mobility. The results suggest that PANI/Ag NC-based sensors have excellent potential for efficient room-temperature gas detection.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a scalable and efficient solution for advanced anomaly detection in network traffic using Azure Databricks and machine learning techniques. Modern networks generate massive volumes of traffic data, making manual detection of anomalies or cyber threats challenging. Traditional tools, such as RDBMS and Hadoop, are slow and not designed for real-time security monitoring. To address these challenges, the proposed system utilizes Azure Databricks, a unified cloud platform for big data processing and machine learning. Network traffic logs were cleaned and transformed using PySpark to extract features, such as IP addresses, session duration, data transfer, and packet counts. K-means clustering was then applied to group similar traffic patterns and identify anomalies without the need for labeled data. Model performance was evaluated using the Silhouette Score to ensure meaningful and well-separated clusters. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in abnormality detection, focusing on emerging technologies and potential future opportunities. All stages, from data ingestion to anomaly detection, were executed within a single databricks notebook, thus requiring a minimal setup. The system performs efficiently even on low-cost Azure plans, making it accessible to small teams, students, and researchers. This solution enables real-time threat detection, automatic scaling, and quick incident response, offering a faster, smarter, and more cost-effective alternative to traditional network security methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (PLCNEC) is a rare and highly aggressive subtype of lung cancer with neuroendocrine features, typically diagnosed at an advanced stage. Its clinical presentation and treatment response resemble those of small cell lung cancer, whereas its histological characteristics are more similar to those of non-small cell lung cancer. The rarity and heterogeneity of PLCNEC have impeded the development of standardized treatment protocols. Conventional approaches such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy alone have yielded poor outcomes, underscoring the need for more effective therapeutic strategies.Case descriptionThis report presents the case of a 45-year-old Chinese woman with advanced PLCNEC who received first-line treatment with a four-drug regimen consisting of etoposide, cisplatin, camrelizumab, and endostar. This was followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab and endostar, local palliative radiotherapy, re-administration of etoposide and cisplatin, and hepatic artery interventional embolization. Notably, her progression-free survival (PFS) after first-line therapy (i.e., PFS1) reached 2 years. Second-line therapy with atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and docetaxel achieved a PFS2 of 1 year. Third-line treatment maintained atezolizumab and introduced the anti-angiogenic agent anlotinib and chemotherapeutic agent pemetrexed, resulting in a PFS3 of 6 months. The patient tolerated all treatments well, with no grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed, and achieved a total overall survival of 47 months.ConclusionsThis case illustrates the potential for long-term survival in advanced PLCNEC through intensive, multi-line combination therapies. The favorable outcome observed in this patient supports further investigation of such combination strategies in clinical studies.",

The insights gained in these domains frame the agenda for the next phase of PGC research. In addition to accelerating integrative common and rare variant-, within- and across-disorder findings for multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, the next phase will leverage multiple populations to further elucidate genetic etiologies, integrate results with rapidly accumulating multi-modal functional genomics data to gain mechanistic understanding, bring genetic findings to clinically actionable phenotypes such as treatment response, and address the emerging use of polygenic scores.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of cyber threats across distributed systems—spanning cloud platforms, edge networks, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystems—demands robust, adaptive mechanisms for malware classification and real-time threat detection. Traditional signature-based and rule-driven detection systems are increasingly ineffective against rapidly evolving threats, such as polymorphic malware and zero-day attacks. This study explores the application of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to build a scalable, real-time malware classification and threat detection framework tailored for distributed environments. It integrates supervised learning models including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting with deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal, behavioral, and structural features from system logs, network flows, and executable binaries. A hybrid ensemble approach enhances generalization across diverse data sources, while online learning capabilities facilitate continuous model updates from live threat intelligence feeds. The framework is deployed within a decentralized monitoring architecture that supports federated learning, ensuring data privacy across distributed endpoints while maintaining high detection accuracy. Evaluation was conducted using benchmark datasets (CICIDS, EMBER, and custom-labeled logs from industrial control systems), achieving a detection accuracy exceeding 96% and a low false-positive rate under real-time constraints. Notably, the model exhibited resilience to adversarial evasion tactics through adaptive retraining mechanisms. The proposed system not only automates threat classification but also enables anomaly detection and threat prioritization for security analysts. This research underscores the growing utility of ML-driven security solutions in managing the complex threat landscape of distributed digital infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "The leading cause of death worldwide is heart disease. To counter this, a Deep Learning (DL) system, a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been developed to lower mortality rates by utilizing clinical insights for early detection. This study presents a novel method for diagnosing heart disease in patients and improving their prognosis. The extensive analysis is supported by multiple datasets sourced from repositories like UCI and Kaggle and locations like Long Beach, Cleveland, Switzerland, and Hungary. Gaussian Noise Removal, Motion Noise Reduction, and Contact Loss Handling (CLH) are used with a Fuzzy Inference System (KL-based FIS) integrated with Kalman filtering during the data preprocessing stage. The state-of-the-art Green Anaconda Optimization (GAO) is used for feature selection, simulating the stages of exploration and exploitation seen in wild green anacondas (GAs). The Multi-Level Group Convolution Light Weight Transformer Network, or LWTNet, which is based on MLGConv, is the foundation of the heart disease classification model. MLGConv is a module that effectively maintains lower computational costs while simultaneously representing multi-level and multi-group features, thereby improving local feature diversity. The Light Former transformer block comes from MLGConv and uses the least processing power to capture global dependencies, resulting in the final LWTNet. The Enhanced PeaFowl Optimization Algorithm (EPFOA) is utilized in the hyperparameter tuning of the classifier model. Interestingly, the suggested model outperforms earlier versions, with a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.87% in a comparative study.",

    "abstract": "Damaging earthquakes happened in the Hainaut coal basin (Belgium) in the 19th and 20th centuries but stopped after coal mining. We relocated 54 Hainaut earthquakes of the period 1965 and 1985 by using regional and local seismic phase measurements from recordings in and around Belgium. These new results finalise the Hainaut earthquake catalogue, derived from macroseismic data for the 1887–1965 period and instrumental records after 1965. This updated database allows us to discuss the origin of this intriguing seismicity. Computed focal depths show that the strongest earthquakes before 1985 occurred inside the Upper Palaeozoic part of the Brabant Parautochton, probably below the deepest parts of the coal mines. The shallowness of this seismicity, its spatial link with the coal basin, the compressive to strike-slip focal mechanisms of the stronger earthquakes between 1965 and 1985 and the large quantity of coal mass removal all match with worldwide observations of mining-triggered earthquakes. The earthquake mechanisms agree with the local, compressive to transpressive stress regime derived from differences in upper crustal density and topography that make the Hainaut area more sensitive to fault reactivation at shallow depths, as observed in similar tectonic settings elsewhere in the world.",

The primary risk factors for NiV infection in Bangladesh are drinking raw date palm sap (DPS) contaminated with Pteropus fruit bat secretions/excretions or close contact with or exposure to the body fluid of an individual with NiV infection. During the 2023 NiV outbreak investigation in Bangladesh, the breast milk of a NiV‐infected nursing mother was tested by real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for detection of NiV‐RNA. The newborn was also tested as a suspected NiV‐infected subject. NiV, specifically NiV RNA, was detected in the breast milk sample. Through the investigation, it was determined that the mother consumed raw DPS 9 days before the delivery. The newborn was also confirmed as NiV positive and had exposure to maternal bodily fluid while breastfeeding, and was in prolonged maternal contact during caregiving. Although the detection of NiV RNA in breast milk does not equate to viability and transmissibility of the virus, this finding provides preliminary evidence that warrants further investigation into the potential role of breast milk in postnatal transmission of NiV. Our findings advocate incorporating breast milk testing into NiV diagnostic protocols for symptomatic mothers. This advancement will broaden our understanding of postnatal transmission of NiV and pave the way for more effective containment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, as well as their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.\n          \n            \n            \n              \n                Published by the American Physical Society\n                2025",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a multi-task prediction model, MT-MBLAE, designed to use DNA methylation data from blood to predict the advancement of Alzheimer’s disease. By integrating various modules, including bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), long short-term memory (LSTM), and RepeatVector, among others, the model encodes DNA methylation profile data, capturing temporal and spatial information from instantaneous DNA methylation spectra data. Leveraging the network properties of BiLSTM and LSTM enables the consideration of both preceding and subsequent information in sequences, facilitating the extraction of richer features and enhancing the model’s comprehension of sequential data. Moreover, the model employs LSTM, time distributed to reconstruct time series DNA methylation profiles. The time-distributed layer applies identical layers at each time step of the sequence, sharing weights and biases uniformly across all time steps. This approach achieves parameter sharing, reduces the model’s parameter count, and ensures consistency in handling time series data. Experimental findings show the excellent performance of the MT-MBLAE model in predicting cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD).",

    "abstract": "Background: Proper nutrition is vital for health and the wellbeing of children. It supports physical growth, brain development, better immune\nfunction, prevent malnutrition and reduces the risk of mortality during the early period of life. However, reduction of malnutrition of the children\nremains highly concerning challenge globally and a priority (P1) program for the government of Nepal. The proportion of stunted and wasted\nchildren below 5 years of age children in Sudurpashchim province were 41 and 14 per thousand live births, respectively, which is significantly higher\nthan the national data, which is 32 and 12 per thousand live births, respectively. These children are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality due\nto severe acute malnutrition. Hence, it was necessary to conduct a district wide campaign to effectively detect malnourished children.\nMethods: The Health Office of Darchula of Sudurpashchim province conducted a district wide campaign reaching out to take anthropometric\nassessment of children below the age of five years between July 1, 2021, and October 15, 2021. The data collected was analyzed to estimate the\nprevalence of malnutrition by types and severity among children of the study group.\nMaterials and Methods: The number of children below five from the Darchula District of Sudurpashchim province 5953. The data collected from\nthese children was analyzed using universal anthropometric assessment. The Emergency Nutrition Assessment (ENA) for Standardized Monitoring\nand Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) software was used to find out the prevalence of malnourished children in Darchula District of\nSudurpashchim province of Nepal. The data was collected between July 1, 2021, and October 15, 2021. The study intended to analyse the findings\nout of 5953 under 5 children assessed from 43 wards of Darchula district where were done. severe acute malnutrition in terms of z-scores, oedema\nand 95% confidence intervals were obtained from data of the nutrition assessment campaign.\nResults: A total of 5953 children from 43 wards from the Darchula District of Sudurpashchim province were admitted into the study. Analysis\nrevealed the prevalence of Global acute malnutrition (GAM) at 10.6 % (CI 9.8 - 11.4 95%), Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) at 2.8 % (CI 2.4 - 3.3\n95%), i.e. 162 children, and 450 children with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). However, before this campaign, only 9 SAM cases (6 in 2019\nand 3 in 2020) were detected and treated during the two previous years.\nConclusion: District wide campaigns was found to be highly effective inn detecting GAM, SAM, and MAM cases that were missed in previous\nlimited interventions. This will permit these new cases to be properly managed through early detection and prevention of the complications.",

    "abstract": "Phishing attack is an attempt to obtain confidential information or data, such as credit and debit card details, username, passwords, etc. by creating a fake website which is very much similar to genuine website. Because of visual similarity of website, users are not able to distinguish between a legitimate and phishing websites. Phishing attack often targets users to enter their personal information at a phishing website. Then that information is directly send to attackers. In today’s world most of the phishing attack takes place with the help of spoofed emails. The attackers first send the email to victim which looks like it’s come from genuine sender. The spoofed email contains the link to such phishing websites. When the victim clicks this link and enters the credentials and information, the information is directly passed on to the attackers. The attackers then misuse this information. Phishing attack is still among the top ten cyber-attacks. Hence, the security experts are looking for a reliable and steady detection mechanism with high accuracy. This paper aims to compare all the phishing website detection techniques.",

Handwritten signatures are often forged for fraudulent purposes,\nnecessitating robust detection methods. Our system aims to classify signatures as genuine or forged by extracting key features\nusing CNN, which captures the intricate details of the signature, such as strokes and angles. PCA is applied to reduce the\ndimensionality of the feature set, ensuring efficient computation without losing critical information. This hybrid approach\nleverages CNN for its strength in feature extraction and PCA for enhancing the discriminative power of those features. Our\nmodel is trained and tested on public datasets, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over traditional methods,\nachieving up to 99.7% recognition accuracy. By applying fixed parameter thresholding, our system effectively detects both\ngenuine and random forgeries, minimizing false positives and negatives.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show gradually lose ability of memory and interpretation, eventually losing the ability to perform the simplest of tasks. Currently, neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are more established methods for detecting AD with high accuracy. Multimodal techniques combined with new deep learning methods can improve the quality of assessment and accurately predict the staging of AD patients. Continuously improving diagnostic methods will pave the way for the future development of promising and effective tools that can simply and accurately detect AD and other neurological disorders at an early stage. While cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers Tau (Tau, Aβ, and neuronal damage), structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and PET imaging have proven to have good results in the diagnosis of AD. Blood biomarkers offer the advantage of effective monitoring of disease progression. Blood biomarker clinical applications will be more affordable, facilitate clinical accessibility, and allow for efficient population screening by accurately predicting AD at an earlier stage in an individual's life in the future. Alzheimer's disease places an enormous burden on patients, their families and caregivers, as well as on the health and social care system and society as a whole. As life expectancy increases worldwide, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is on the rise, and in order to improve the quality of life of older adults, it is urgent to find ways to prevent or delay the onset of the disease and subsequent dementia. While there are currently no drugs on the market that can reverse the initial pathological changes associated with the disease, early diagnosis in the disease course provides time for all involved to make adjustments so that the patient himself can still be actively involved in the treatment process. As a result, many patients without severe symptoms can live for many years with a good quality of life with access to the best treatment and resources.",

The biosensor interface was enhanced with thiolated polystyrene and gold nanospheres to ensure stable peptide immobilization and resist nonspecific adsorption. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed each step of the electrode modification, while surface morphology was validated via scanning electron microscopy. A Python-based deep learning algorithm was applied to impedance data for efficient curve fitting and regression modeling. The biosensor demonstrated high sensitivity, with a linear detection range of 5–600 pg/mL, a regression coefficient (R\n            2) of 0.9946, a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.62 pg/mL, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.91 pg/mL. Chronoimpedimetric (CI) detection revealed that gp41 binding occurred within 350 s. The biosensor showed excellent reproducibility (CV % = 0.22%), good selectivity with less than 12% signal variation in spiked serum, and robust stability, maintaining functionality after extended storage. These results highlight the biosensor's potential as a rapid, sensitive, and reproducible diagnostic platform for early HIV detection.",

In this paper, we apply Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to a simulated credit card transaction dataset to detect fraudulent transactions. We show that they outperform traditional methods by leveraging relational patterns in the data when trained on the same features.

Nine PO cows were selected based on ultrasonographic and rectal palpation examinations, which confirmed active follicular development. Serum samples were collected and analyzed for total protein concentration, ranging from 55.73 to 70.23 mg/mL. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed varied protein profiles, with 3 to 10 bands observed per sample, indicating physiological diversity among the subjects. AMH protein was isolated using electroelution following SDS-PAGE separation. Western blot results confirmed that the immunogenic AMH protein was detected at a molecular weight of 60–70 kDa, aligning with the expected size for bovine AMH. The purified protein was used for immunization in rabbits to produce polyclonal antibodies. The successful detection and specificity of the anti-AMH antibodies support their potential use in reproductive physiology studies and the development of immunodiagnostic tools.",

    "abstract": "Purpose : This study examined the status of medication use and factors associated with medication misuse among older adults receiving in-home services under Long-Term Care Insurance.Methods : A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 134 older adults aged 65 years and above who had registered at nine daycare centers. Data were collected through structured interviews regarding sociodemographic characteristics, depression, activities of daily living, cognitive function, social support, and medication misuse. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for analysis.Results : On average, they were administered medications 1.98 times daily and consumed 4.41 medications per administration. Medication misuse was observed in 28.4% of the participants. Factors significantly associated with medication misuse included depression, lower monthly household income (OR=3.34, 95% CI: 1.30–8.56), and the experience of medication side effects (OR=9.67, 95% CI: 2.05–45.64).Conclusion : The findings of this study highlight the need for integrated interventions that include regular screening for depression and the close monitoring of medication-related adverse events. Enhancing the involvement of daycare center staff—particularly nursing personnel—in medication education and supervision is advised to mitigate misuse and promote safe medication practices.",

This paper applies machine learning (ML) techniques to intelligently detect and prevent such malicious traffic in IoT environments. The paper explains in detail how ML techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and federated learning can be used to enhance the security posture of IoT by detecting malicious patterns in real time, adaptively, and accurately. Special emphasis is placed on the malicious traffic categories that are unique to IoT, the shortcomings of traditional intrusion detection systems, and how intelligent ML-based approaches can overcome these issues through autonomous feature learning and behavioral analysis. Key challenges such as data imbalance, weak generalization capabilities, real-time processing requirements, and model vulnerability to adversarial attacks are discussed in detail. The paper concludes by pointing out future research avenues for efficient, scalable, and explainable machine learning-based security solutions for IoT, making this review a comprehensive roadmap for advancing intelligent information security to address impending cyber threats.",

    "abstract": "In children, little is known on gut microbiota (GM) in end-stage liver disease and its association with graft function after pediatric liver transplantation (pLT). We analyzed GM composition and function in children before pLT, longitudinally post-pLT and in long-term survivors (LT-pLT) in order to assess the impact of disease severity, treatment and pLT on GM and delineate associations with graft and patient health. Fecal samples (FS) of 29 children (17f, age 2.6 [0.2-15.7] years) awaiting pLT were included with longitudinal follow-ups until 12M post-transplant in 18, and compared with 38 LT-pLT (21f, age 11 [2.7-17.7] years, 7.8 [1.0-17.0] years post-pLT) and 94 healthy controls (HC). Samples were analyzed using quantitative 16S rRNA gene analyses combined with shotgun metagenomics (subset of samples). Pre-pLT patients showed reduced alpha-diversities and altered GM composition compared with LT-pLT and HC, associated with disease severity and anti-pruritic treatment with Rifampicin. Dysbiosis increased after pLT and started to recover after 3M. Although bacterial concentrations, alpha diversity and gene richness increased post-pLT, levels remained below those of HC. Abundances of key functions, e.g. the capacity to synthesize butyrate, also remained reduced. Quantitative analyses revealed true extent of differences between patients and HC that were underestimated using relative abundance data. GM diversity and functional capacities correlated negatively with transaminase levels mid- and long-term after pLT. Random Forest analyses based on GM were able to predict hepatocellular damage at high accuracy (AUC: 0.89). We provide comprehensive, quantitative insights into GM composition and function before and after pLT. A link between GM alterations with (long-term) graft health was uncovered providing possible targets to modulate GM function in order to increase graft and patient health.",

    "issuedDate": "2025-6-30",
    "abstract": "The article addresses the problem of determining the permissible long-term load for power transformers while considering their thermal regime. The relevance of this work is due to the high level of physical wear and tear on transformer equipment and the need to improve its operational reliability. Exceeding the temperature of windings and oil accelerates insulation aging, necessitating the development of methods to predict the thermal state of transformers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this work is to develop a methodology for determining the permissible long-term load of a transformer depending on ambient temperature. The scientific novelty lies in the development of an approximate model of the thermal operating mode of a power transformer, allowing for the prediction of element temperatures and permissible loads.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods. Research methods include mathematical modeling using Newton – Rikhman equations to describe heat exchange between thermally homogeneous elements of the transformer. The fourth-order Runge – Kutta method with a time step of 30 seconds was used for numerical solution of the system of differential equations. Calculations were performed using author-developed programs in Python with Numpy and Matplotlib libraries. A comparative analysis of simulation results with experimental data from open sources and GOST 14209-85 requirements was conducted.\r\n\r\nResults. A mathematical model is proposed, treating the transformer as a system of three thermally homogeneous elements – the core, windings, and oil – with heat exchange described by Newton – Rikhman equations. Equations are obtained that make it possible to determine the steady-state temperature of transformer elements and the maximum allowable load factor, taking into account the limitation of the temperature of the winding and oil, the set ambient temperature and the load factor. Approximate formulas were obtained for determining the volumes and contact surface areas of transformer elements based on a calculation scheme. Ratios are presented that allow these values to be estimated approximately depending on the rated power for geometrically similar transformers. It was shown that the heat transfer coefficient between the oil and the environment has the greatest impact on the thermal regime. A condition for the permissible operation of the transformer was formulated, taking into account the required load level and ambient temperature. Simulation results were validated by comparison with experimental data.\r\n\r\nConclusions. A mathematical model of the transformer’s thermal regime has been proposed, taking into account the inertia of temperature changes in its thermally homogeneous elements. The influence of the load factor and ambient temperature on the steady-state temperature values of the elements has been determined. A condition for the permissible operation of the transformer has been obtained, ensuring the limitation of winding and oil temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria from the genera Pectobacterium and Dickeya cause blackleg and soft rot in potatoes. Isolating these pathogens from symptomatic plant tissues presents challenges due to the cohabitation of multiple microbes and the limitations of traditional isolation methods. In this study, culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to identify Pectobacterium species from symptomatic blackleg samples collected from Pennsylvania potato fields. Metagenomic classification tools were used to detect Pectobacterium spp. and compare the results with culture-based isolates. The findings showed concordance between culture-based and metagenomic analysis in identifying Pectobacterium species. Metagenomic approaches effectively detected Pectobacterium spp. in most samples; however, pathogen abundance varied significantly within and across fields, highlighting the stochastic nature of microbial distribution. These results underscore the importance of employing rigorous methodologies when using plant disease diagnostic tools. Integrating culture-dependent and metagenomic approaches enhances our understanding of pathogen diversity and spatial distribution, ultimately contributing to more effective disease monitoring and control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among ICU patients. Standard care often involves prolonged antibiotic courses, risking adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Recent studies suggest shorter courses may be equally efficacious but specifically tailored evidence for ICU patients is limited. We conducted a unicentric, retrospective observational study analyzing the outcomes of 400 ICU patients with HCAP treated with 7-day or 14-day antibiotic therapy at the Surgical Intensive Care Unit P17, Ibn Rochd University Hospital between January 2023 and February 2025. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at day 14; secondary endpoints included development of resistant organisms, ICU length of stay (LOS), mortality, and adverse events. Our findings demonstrated non-inferiority of the short-course regimen, with comparable cure rates and improved safety profiles. The short course was associated with significantly fewer resistant organisms and adverse effects, suggesting a paradigm shift in ICU pneumonia management. These results support updates in antibiotic stewardship policies, emphasizing personalized, shorter treatment durations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In recent years, computer vision and machine learning have achieved remarkable advancements across health care, autonomous systems, and robotics sectors. However, the educational domain, particularly the automated detection of student engagement in online and offline learning environments, remains rich in research opportunities. Detecting student engagement is inherently complex and requires sophisticated interpretive capabilities. This paper introduces a novel approach to automatically detect and classify student engagement by integrating facial images with behavioral and facial features, providing a comprehensive solution to enhance engagement recognition. This study begins by extracting behavioral features and correlating them with pre-defined engagement labels to perform engagement classification using machine learning techniques. In parallel, deep learning models are trained and validated on both image and behavioral features, offering a complementary approach. Additionally, the relationship between facial action units (AUs) and engagement labels is analyzed using three distinct metrics: conditional activation probability, relative activation ratio, and the statistical discriminant coefficient (SDC). The study utilizes publicly available datasets (WACV and DAiSEE) to perform extensive evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating action units significantly enhances model performance, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy (82.9%) among traditional models and EfficientNet reaching the best performance (47.2%) in deep learning experiments. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal approaches in improving real-time engagement detection, offering valuable insights into educational technologies and pedagogy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Top-down effects of larger-grained linguistic chunks on their smaller-grained constituent parts have been established in both reading and speaking. However, typing as a domain of language production has been less thoroughly investigated in this regard. In the current paper, we present a copy task in which participants were shown a stimulus and asked to type it. Their keystrokes were recorded, allowing insight into both typing fluency (in interkey intervals, or IKIs) and latency to typing onset (in response times, or RTs). Critically, stimuli varied in both lexical status (words vs. non-words) and collocational status (frequently co-occurring vs. novel word pairs). As expected, non-words were reacted to and typed more slowly than words. At the group level, collocated word pairs were initiated and typed slightly faster than non-collocated pairs, but this effect was not statistically significant. However, evidence emerged for considerable individual differences in the trade-off between RTs and IKIs, suggesting that typers differ in the stage at which they benefit from top-down facilitation when typing collocated word pairs. This complements previous research on top-down effects and is consistent with the view that the mental processing blocks supporting written language production and comprehension may align—though the extent and timing of such alignment appear to vary across individuals.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid construction and development of smart grids, accurately identifying abnormalities in transformers is of great practical significance for the safe operation of power systems. However, traditional transformer anomaly detection methods make it difficult to effectively detect anomalies inside the transformer from a single source of transformer data. In this paper, we propose a transformer anomaly detection method based on multi-source information fusion of insulating oil, which uses an anomaly detection and diagnosis model with a deep Transform network structure. Specifically, our method contains four modules. The Transformer module is used to receive oil and gas decomposition data in the transformer and uses an attention-based sequence encoder to quickly perform inference knowledge to obtain broader transformer operation time trend data. The Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) module accepts transformer temperature and bushing temperature data and uses a gating mechanism and a status update mechanism to capture features in the sequence. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) module receives the oil chromatography information at the time of operation of the transformer and uses convolution operations to extract the spatial features in the oil chromatography data. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module takes the inputs of the above three modules as input and uses fully connected layers and softmax layers to accurately classify the data. We conducted extensive experiments on real data sets, and the experimental results show that the Accuracy of our proposed method reaches 98.87%, and the F1 reaches 99.40%, surpassing all baseline classifiers, and the F1 exceeds the state-of-the-art method by 3.77%. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different models and features on detection results.",

    "abstract": "Neck of femur (NOF) fractures are a critical orthopaedic emergency with a high morbidity and mortality prevalence, particularly in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWHIV). A combination of HIV infection, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), and compromised bone health further increases the risk of fragility fractures. Additionally, HIV-related immune dysfunction, cART-induced osteoporosis, and perioperative infection risks further pose challenges in ongoing surgical management. Despite the rising global prevalence of PLWHIV, no specific guidelines exist for the perioperative and post-operative care of PLWHIV undergoing NOF fracture surgery. This narrative review synthesises the current literature on the surgical management of NOF fractures in PLWHIV, focusing on pre-operative considerations, intraoperative strategies, post-operative complications, and long-term outcomes. It also explores infection control, fracture healing dynamics, and ART’s impact on surgical outcomes while identifying key research gaps. A systematic database search (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) identified relevant studies published up to February 2025. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on incidence, risk factors, ART impact, and NOF fracture outcomes in PLWHIV. Data were analysed to summarise findings and highlight knowledge gaps. Pre-operative care: Optimisation involves assessing immune status (namely, CD4 counts and HIV-1 viral loads), bone health, and cART to minimise surgical risk. Immunodeficiency increases surgical site and periprosthetic infection risks, necessitating potential enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis and close monitoring of potential start/switch/stopping of such therapies. Surgical management of neck of femur (NOF) fractures in PLWHIV should be individualised based on fracture type (intracapsular or extracapsular), age, immune status, bone quality, and functional status. Extracapsular fractures are generally managed with internal fixation using dynamic hip screws or intramedullary nails. For intracapsular fractures, internal fixation may be appropriate for younger patients with good bone quality, though there is an increased risk of non-union in this group. Hemiarthroplasty is typically favoured in older or frailer individuals, offering reduced surgical stress and lower operative time. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is considered for active patients or those with pre-existing hip joint disease but carries a higher infection risk in immunocompromised individuals. Multidisciplinary evaluation is critical in guiding the most suitable surgical approach for PLWHIV. Importantly, post-operative care carries the risk of higher infection rates, requiring prolonged antibiotic use and wound surveillance. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) contributes to bone demineralisation and chronic inflammation, increasing delayed union healing and non-union risk. HIV-related frailty, neurocognitive impairment, and socioeconomic barriers hinder rehabilitation, affecting recovery. The management of NOF fractures in PLWHIV requires a multidisciplinary, patient-centred approach ideally comprising a team of Orthopaedic surgeon, HIV Physician, Orthogeriatric care, Physiotherapy, Occupational Health, Dietitian, Pharmacist, Psychologist, and related Social Care. Optimising cART, tailoring surgical strategies, and enforcing strict infection control can improve outcomes. Further high-quality studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are essential to develop evidence-based guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration associated with beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles. Traditional diagnostic tools, while effective in advanced stages, often lack sensitivity for early detection, delaying intervention and limiting treatment efficacy. Innovations in neuroimaging, including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology, offer promising advancements in the early identification of AD-related pathologies. Objective: To systematically evaluate the role of advanced neuroimaging techniques—particularly those augmented by AI and nanotechnology—in the early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in May 2025 using PubMed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and Sci-Hub. Search strategies incorporated MeSH terms and free-text keywords. From 503 identified records, 50 studies met inclusion criteria based on relevance to neuroimaging in human AD diagnosis. Data extraction focused on imaging modality, diagnostic performance, population characteristics, and analytic methods. Results: Structural MRI consistently identified hippocampal and medial temporal lobe atrophy, while functional MRI revealed disrupted connectivity in key cognitive networks. PET imaging, particularly with amyloid and tau tracers, demonstrated early molecular changes. AI-based models enhanced diagnostic accuracy across modalities, and nanoparticle-enhanced imaging showed improved sensitivity in preclinical detection. Conclusion: Advanced neuroimaging, particularly when integrated with AI and nanotechnology, significantly improves early diagnostic capabilities in Alzheimer’s disease. These modalities hold potential for earlier intervention, personalized monitoring, and better patient outcomes, although challenges related to standardization, cost, and clinical translation persist.",

Quality of life (QoL) is a multidimensional concept encompassing physical, psychological, and social well-being, influenced by various factors, including formal and informal social support. In contexts such as Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) and Daycare Centers (DCs), understanding how these variables interact is essential for implementing strategies that promote the well-being of older adults.\nThis study aims to examine the relationships between the presence, regularity, and perceived importance of visits from informal social support networks and the perception of quality of life among older adults residing in LTCFs and attending DCs. A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional, and comparative methodology was used. Participants included 87 individuals (n=42, LTCFs; n=45, DCs), predominantly women, widowed, and with low educational levels, aged between 65 and 99 years (M=82.90; SD=7.50). The instruments administered were a sociodemographic questionnaire and the WHOQOL-Bref.\nThe results indicate that in LTCFs, the importance attributed to visits contributes to better social relationships. In DCs, visits from family/friends are highly valued, and their regularity influences the importance assigned to them. It is concluded that maintaining affective ties is essential for the QoL of older adults, reinforcing the need for policies and practices that encourage informal social support, promoting well-being, social integration, and quality of life throughout aging.",

    "abstract": "Solid State Drives (SSDs) based on the NVMe Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) interface can notably reduce the costs of address mapping, garbage collection, and over-provisioning by dividing the storage space into multiple zones for sequential writes and random reads. The Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree, which is extensively used in key-value storage systems, converts random writes to sequential writes, hence a suitable scenario to utilize ZNS SSDs. However, LSM tree associated data significantly varies in lifetime due to the levels and merging mechanisms of the LSM tree. Therefore, without an accurate method to estimate data lifetime, data with disparate lifetimes may be placed in the same zone, thus causing low space utilization and high write amplification within the SSD.\n          To address these issues, the article proposes two data overlapping aware optimizations to realize intelligent data placement: a zone allocation scheme and a garbage collection scheme. The key technique of these optimizations is an accurate data-lifetime estimation by considering both the associated tree level of the data and the data overlapping ratio between the data and those in the neighboring level. Using the estimation technique, the zone allocation optimization can place data with similar lifetimes in the same zone. Besides, the garbage collection optimization can reclaim zones in an adaptive manner based on overlapping ratios to reduce the amount of data migration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimization schemes effectively reduce garbage collection-incurred data copy by average factors of 2.11× and 1.50× in comparison to a conventional work and a state-of-the-art work, respectively. Consequently, the proposed work successfully alleviates the write amplification effect by 18% and 6%, compared to the conventional work and the state-of-the-art work, respectively.",

Legumes are of great importance in developing countries where access to animal protein sources is difficult. Cowpea grains and leaves are a source of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, ß-carotene and vitamins B and C necessary for a healthy diet. This study was conducted to investigate the mineral matter contents of different foliar applications of microbial fertilizer to some cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal malignancies worldwide, primarily due to its frequent diagnosis at advanced\nstages, which contributes to a notably low five-year survival rate. The organ’s deep anatomical position within the abdominal\ncavity, often concealed by surrounding structures, poses significant challenges for early clinical detection through conventional\nexaminations. However, early identification is achievable with advanced medical imaging modalities like computed tomography\n(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent developments in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have\ndemonstrated encouraging potential in enhancing the detection of pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage. This study introduces a\ncomprehensive framework that extends current CAD methodologies by incorporating five integrated components: image\npreprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The preprocessing\nstage enhances image clarity using color transformation and isotropic diffusion filtering. For segmentation, a U-Net-based\nneural architecture effectively delineates tumor regions. Subsequent feature extraction, performed using a ResNet-50 model,\ncaptures key image attributes such as contrast, correlation, and dissimilarity. A hybrid classification model, combining Deep\nConvolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN), is employed to distinguish between malignant and\nbenign tissues. To promote transparency and clinical acceptance, interpretability tools like Grad-CAM and SHAP are integrated,\noffering visual and statistical insights into model decision-making",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of slow deep breathing exercises on cardiopulmonary function, physical performance, biochemical markers, oxidative stress, and stress levels in older adult patients with long COVID. Methods: Sixty older adult patients with long COVID were randomly assigned to an exercise group of 30 patients and a control group of 30 patients. The exercise group engaged in slow deep breathing exercises for 30 minutes, five times a week over a period of 8 weeks, while the control group maintained their usual activities. Cardiovascular parameters, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory muscle strength (RMS), pulmonary function tests (PFT), physical performance, biochemical and oxidative stress markers, and stress levels were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The exercise group showed significant reductions in cardiovascular parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate). Additionally, RMS, PFT, and physical performance showed significant increases. Improvements were also observed in HRV, biochemical markers (fasting blood sugar and lipid profile), oxidative stress markers (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde), and stress levels. In contrast, no significant changes were found in the control group. Conclusion: Slow deep breathing exercises, as a non-pharmacological intervention, significantly improve cardiopulmonary function, physical performance, and various health markers in older adult patients with long COVID. This approach provides a valuable and accessible therapeutic option for this population.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine if the microbiota in four different oral sites and the oral health status differ between patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), non-pSS sicca symptoms, and healthy controls. All participants underwent an interview and clinical oral examination. Stimulated whole saliva (SWS), supragingival plaque (SGP), buccal mucosa tissue (BLM), and tongue scrape (TGS) samples from 23 pSS patients, 36 patients with sicca symptoms, not fulfilling the classification criteria for pSS (non-pSS sicca), and 21 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using V3–V4 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and determination of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).PSS and non-pSS sicca patients did not differ with respect to oral health status, saliva flow rates, abundance of predominant genera, relative abundance on genus level or bacterial diversity in any of the oral sites. Both patient groups differed significantly from the healthy control group in the abundance of 61 ASVs across all sites. The alpha-diversity was lower in SGP from non-pSS sicca patients (p = 0.019), and in TGS from pSS patients (p = 0.04). The proportion of variation in the beta-diversity across all four sites could be explained by the diagnosis (pSS, non-pSS sicca, and HC). However, subgrouping of patients according to their stimulated salivary flow rates (SWS &gt; 0.7 ml/min versus SWS  0.7 ml/min), revealed significantly different abundance of three ASVs in SWS, 11 in SGP, and six in TGS. Our findings suggest that hyposalivation rather than pSS itself modifies the microbial composition in oral site-specific patterns leading to oral diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n        Network intrusion detection data has the problem of class imbalance, and the distribution of training data is inconsistent with the distribution of the real detection data, which leads to the serious performance degradation of network intrusion detection system. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a domain adaptation network intrusion detection algorithm based on class-balanced knowledge transfer and multi-structure domain alignment. Firstly, the source domain is extended by the generative adversarial network to alleviate the data class imbalance, the class separation loss is proposed to reduce the impact of class overlap caused by data imbalance processing on cross-domain knowledge transfer, the rich knowledge of the source domain is transferred to the target domain to generate the target domain pseudo labels, and the dynamic threshold is used to lter the high condence target domain data for the subsequent domain alignment. Furthermore, multi-structure domain alignment is proposed to reduce data distribution di erences between source domain and target domain. The domain-invariant features of source domain and target domain are extracted by reducing the domain di erence caused by the dependence structure between di erent domains. The difference of local relative structure of class prototypes in di erent domains is reduced through supervised Class Prototype Discovery and class prototype relative structure alignment. Combining the domain adversarial network to align the overall distribution of data in di erent domains and the overall structure of class prototypes, the classi er can obtain more robust decision boundary. Experiments on four NIDS reference datasets, UNSWNB15, NSL-KDD,ToN-IoT, BoT-IoT, verify the e ectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the cross-domain scenarios.",

GO, KEGG enrichment and WGCNA were used to identify key genes, and their expression levels in three tea tree varieties were validated by qRT-PCR.ResultIn this study, we measured the internode lengths of the three varieties and found that their internode lengths were ‘Feiyun’ &amp;gt; ‘Qiancha 1’ &amp;gt; ‘Longjing 43’. 10,518 differentially expressed genes were identified through transcriptome sequencing and analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment showed that these differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction and DNA-binding transcription factor activity pathways. WGCNA analysis identified two modules significantly correlated with internode length. Combining enrichment analysis with WGCNA results, 28 candidate genes associated with internode length were identified. In addition, it was found that the expression levels of DELLA and GA3ox were highly expressed in ‘Longjing 43’, while GA2ox, WRKY, and ERF were highly expressed in ‘Feiyun’, showing significant positive and negative correlations with internode length, respectively.DiscussionOur results provide candidate genes for studying the molecular mechanism of stem elongation, and provide a theoretical basis for selection machine harvested tea varieties and improvement of mechanical harvesting efficiency.",

However, GANs also perform video deep-fake detection along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). We also used feature extraction to derive basic facial expressions. The best results are obtained using methods based on EfficientNet B7. The accuracy for the state-of-the-art approach in detection is around 88%. Using such mentioned deep learning models, we aim to improve them and increase the accuracy to 93%, with minimal fluctuations to enhance the reliability and robustness of deep fake detection systems.",

    "abstract": "A novel approach that seamlessly integrates human action recognition and object detection in hybrid deep learning architectures for the enhancement of accuracy in shoplifting prevention and detection remains largely unexplored to date. This innovative concept has a transformative potential in the security surveillance domain. While both ConvLSTM and CNN_LSTM hybrid techniques possess strong spatio-temporal information processing capabilities, the study explored the effect of the simultaneous application of spatial and temporal data in a ConvLSTM architecture in comparison to the isolated capturing of intricate optical patterns and time dynamics in CNN_LSTM composite structure. Both models were trained and tested on a common annotated dataset of normal shopping behaviour, suspicious activity and shoplifting that explicitly differentiated precrime behavioural cues from shoplifting activity. The ConvLSTM attained an 80% accuracy outperforming 69% accuracy for CNN_LSTM. The study unveils the excellent capability of ConvLSTM in processing sequential optical data paving way for advanced smart surveillance techniques. Future research can focus on leveraging transfer learning and integration with lightweight architectures like YOLO for refined real-time detections.",

    "abstract": "Ride-hailing services provides convenient, affordable, and on-demand travel options. However, the rapid expansion of\nthese platforms has introduced security challenges, including illegal driver substitution. This issue arises when unauthorized\nindividuals operate as drivers, jeopardizing passenger safety.

Water samples were collected biweekly over a period of 24 months from the rivers (Ureje, Emirin, Ogbese, Odo-Ayo and Elemi). Isolation of bacteria, antibiotics susceptibility testing of the isolates and detection of virulence genes were carried out using standard methods. The bacteria isolated include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, B. cereus, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas spp, Proteus vulgaris. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolates showed that both Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance. Of the 423 bacterial isolates, 226 were positive to biofilm formation, 78 to heamolysin formation, 87 to phospholipase and 76 to gelatinase production. Virulence genes stn, spvC and invA were detected in Salmonella typhi (EM22), fimH and sxt1genes were detected in E. coli (Urj.23) and Shigella dysenteriae (EM6), fimH, rmpA and entB genes were detected in Klebsiella pneumoniae (Ogb4). In Bacillus cereus (EM4), nheA, hblC and hblD genes were detected while oprL, exoS and oprI genes were detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ELE12). The findings of this study suggests that water from the rivers are of poor microbial qualities, the bacterial isolates were multiple antibiotic resistant with various virulence genes.

    "issuedDate": "2025-6-30",
    "abstract": "The process of sensing and transmitting acoustic signals by pervasive acoustic wireless sensor networks (PAWSNs) poses considerable energy challenges. These problems may be mitigated by filtering only relevant acoustic events from the sensor network. By reducing the number of acoustic events, the frequency of communication may be decreased, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Although traditional machine learning models are capable of predicting relevant acoustic events by being trained on suitable data sets, they are impractical for direct implementation on resource-limited acoustic sensor nodes. To address this issue, this research introduces TinyML-based acoustic event detection (AED) models which facilitate efficient real-time processing on microcontrollers with scarce hardware resources. The study develops several TinyML models using an environmental dataset and evaluates their accuracy. These models are then deployed in hardware to assess their performance in terms of AED. Thanks to such an approach, only predicted events that exceed a certain threshold are transmitted to the base station via router nodes, which reduces the transmission burden, thus improving energy efficiency of PAWSNs. Real-time experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly improves energy efficiency and boosts node lifetime.",

Despite its crucial role, the impact of the rumen microbiome on average daily gain (ADG) in Xuzhou cattle remains underexplored. Xuzhou cattle is a well-known breed in China, renowned for rapid growth and superior meat quality. We selected 10 individuals from the Xuzhou cattle population and categorized Xuzhou cattle into High-ADG and Low-ADG groups and analyzed their rumen microbiota. Through comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, we characterized the microbial diversity and functional composition of the rumen microbiome, uncovering distinct taxonomic and functional alterations associated with ADG. Thirteen kingdoms, 224 phyla, and over 16,000 species were identified, and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated significant microbial differentiation between the two groups on phylum, genus, and species levels (\n              P\n              &lt; 0.05). Notably, Lentisphaerae, along with several other genera and species, presented a higher abundance in High, suggesting a potential connection with enhanced growth performance. Further functional annotation revealed that the High group displayed enriched carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism pathways, with a greater abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), particularly those involved in the degradation of complex carbohydrates. The Low-ADG group exhibited reduced metabolic activity in these pathways. Metabolomic analysis revealed 10 significantly altered metabolites, including gamma-glutamyltyrosine and N-acetylaspartic acid, which were upregulated in the High-ADG group, indicating their potential role in growth promotion. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis further uncovered significant interactions between key microbiomes and metabolites, which correlated with ADG. Random forest analysis identified Victivallales and Lentisphaerae as key taxa, with gamma-glutamyltyrosine and Asp-Phe emerging as predictive biomarkers for ADG.\n            \n          \n          \n            IMPORTANCE\n            This study identifies key microbiota (Victivallales and Lentisphaerae) and metabolites (gamma-glutamyltyrosine, Asp-Phe, N-acetylaspartic acid, Gly-Phe) that positively regulate average daily gain (ADG) in Xuzhou cattle through amino acid metabolism. This fundamental information is vital for the development of potential manipulation strategies to improve the daily gain level through precision feeding.",

    "abstract": "AbstractObjectiveClosed‐loop neurostimulation is a promising treatment for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. A major challenge is fast and reliable seizure detection via electroencephalography (EEG). Although many approaches have been published, they often lack statistical power and practical utility. The use of various EEG preprocessing parameters and performance metrics hampers comparability. Additionally, the critical issue of energy consumption for an application in medical devices is rarely considered. Addressing these points, we present a systematic analysis of the impact of EEG preprocessing parameters on seizure detection performance and energy consumption, using one to four EEG channels.MethodsWe analyzed in 145 patients with focal epilepsy the impact of different sampling rates, window sizes, digital resolutions, and number of EEG channels on seizure detection performance and energy consumption. Focusing on clinically relevant, event‐based metrics, we evaluated seizure detection performance of a state‐of‐the‐art convolutional neural network (CNN) via the Seizure Community Open‐Source Research Evaluation (SzCORE) framework. Statistical relevance of parameter changes was assessed using linear mixed‐effects models. Energy consumption was analyzed using an ultra‐low‐power microcontroller.ResultsReducing the sampling rate from 256 to 64 Hz decreased sensitivity (p = .015) and false detections per hour (FD/h; p = .002). Larger windows reduced FD/h between 1 s and all other sizes (all p &lt; .001). Lower digital resolution decreased sensitivity between 16 and 8 bits (p = .007). Using one EEG channel instead of four decreased sensitivity (p &lt; .001) and increased detection delay (p = .020), but also reduced FD/h (p = .005). Reducing the sampling rate to 64 Hz lowered CNN energy consumption from 49.15 to 17.26 μJ/s, and using one channel reduced it from 79.04 to 31.63 μJ/s.SignificanceThis study provides guidance on choosing EEG preprocessing parameters for innovative developments of closed‐loop neurostimulation devices to further advance the treatment of drug‐resistant focal epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "This study simulates the labor market dynamics in Germany during 1914-1920, focusing on the impact of World War I on wage expectations and economic stability. Built upon the historical context of the period, the simulation takes into account the initial wage hikes driven by involuntary unemployment and the exodus of workers from civilian industries to war-related industries. It then explores the subsequent stabilization of wages, as observed in the empirical reality of the era. Using simulated data, the paper examines how workers’ expectations of future wages were shaped by current wage conditions amidst the economic strain caused by the war. The study also investigates the role of national unity, government policies, and institutional frameworks in preserving wage stability during market volatility. To analyze wage dynamics, the research applies a dynamic wage model alongside the FIGARCH (1, d,1) model, estimating long-memory effects in wage volatility. The findings suggest that past economic conditions played a significant role in shaping current wage expectations, with light long-memory properties observed in wage volatility. This simulated analysis offers insights into how economic pressures and government interventions during wartime may have contributed to wage stability, shaping the uncertainty of workers into forecasting the war ending which goes in accordance with the martingale hypothesis of wages expectations. Our study is contextual and qualitative and discusses the properties of economical series based on the context of the period.",

    "abstract": "Effective intervention and the avoidance of long-term psychological and emotional repercussions depend on early\nrecognition of depression. However, because its early symptoms are subtle, complex, and vary from person to person, they are\nfrequently disregarded [1]. Timely diagnosis is made more difficult by the fact that many persons in the early stages of depression\nmay not seek care or may find it difficult to express their feelings [2]. This study presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI)\nframework for analysing multimodal data, including text, voice tone, and facial expressions, in order to identify early indicators\nof depression. The proposed system integrates cutting-edge deep learning modals: BERT is used for understanding contextual\nlinguistic cues [3], CNNs extract significant emotional indicators from facial features [4], and RNNs capture the temporal\ndynamics and tone shifts in speech [5].\nThese modalities are fused through a structured data integration strategy, enabling the system to interpret emotional patterns\nmore holistically and accurately. When tested using benchmark datasets like DAIC-WOZ [6], the system shows excellent\naccuracy and dependability in real-time, non-intrusive identification of depressed signs. Deeper emotional analysis is made\npossible by the integration of language, auditory, and visual information, which also increases the model’s generalizability and\nrobustness across a range of topics [7]. With its scalable, easily available, and objective tools that enhance conventional\napproaches, this work demonstrates the expanding potential of AI in mental health care [8]. This paradigm facilitates prompt\ndiagnosis and creates opportunities for tailored intervention methods by providing professionals with early, data-driven insights.\nIn the end, it brings us one step closer to a time when technology can help to improve mental health and lessen the prevalence of\nuntreated depression worldwide.",

Real‐time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long‐term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion‐selective microsensor for long‐term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long‐term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer‐based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.",

    "authors": "Greg Klazura",
    "issuedDate": "2025-6-30",
    "abstract": "Background: In 2022 there were only seven pediatric surgeons in Uganda, but approximately 170 are needed. Consequently, Ugandan general surgeons treat most pediatric surgical problems at regional hospitals. Accordingly, stakeholders created the Pediatric Emergency Surgery Course, which teaches rural providers identification, resuscitation, treatment and referral of pediatric surgical conditions. To improve course offerings and better understand pediatric surgery needs we collected admission and operative logbook data from four participating sites. One participating site, Lacor Hospital, rarely referred patients and had a much higher operative volume. Therefore, we sought to understand the causes of this difference and the resulting economic impact.\n\nMethods: Over a four-year period, data was collected from logbooks at four different regional referral hospitals in Uganda. Patients &lt;18 years old with a surgical diagnosis were included. Patient length of stay, referral volume, age and case type were compared between sites and DALYs were calculated and converted into monetary benefit.\n\nResults: Over four sites, 8,615 admissions and 5,457 cases were included. Lacor patients were younger, had a longer length of stay and were referred less. Additionally, Lacor’s long-term partnerships with a high-income country institution, a missionary organization and visiting Ugandan and international pediatric surgeons were unique. In 2018, the pediatric surgery case volume was: Lacor (967); Fort Portal (477); Kiwoko (393) and Kabale (153), resulting in a substantial difference in long-term monetary health benefit.\n\nConclusion: Long-term international partnerships may advance investments in surgical infrastructure, workforce and education in low- and middle-income countries. This collaborative model allows stakeholders to make a greater impact than any single institution could make alone.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Cybersecurity is a critical component influencing the safe and stable operation of the smart grid, as the smart grid (SG) is an information-physical fusion system (also known as a Cyber-Physical System [CPS]) integrating sensing, communication, computation, decision-making, and control built on the foundation of the traditional grid. The most common cyberattack that compromises data integrity in the smart grid is the False Date Injection Attack (FDIA). If this type of attack is not discovered in time, it can take control of physical equipment or target a network transmission line to obstruct control decisions, which can result in power network failure or even a cascade failure in the grid. An integrated learning-based detection method is currently proposed to biclassify power grid data in order to address the issues of low accuracy, high false detection rate, and poor model differentiation ability when applying a single classifier in machine learning to detect false data. The integrated learning detection method is based on GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree), XGBoost, and Light GBM, with RF- Light GBM and Bagging classifier as the base classifiers, which are integrated by voting strategy after Bayesian tuning. Following simulation experiments, the algorithm is able to significantly outperform the checking rate and accuracy of traditional detection algorithms in detecting false data on the power grid by effectively addressing the issues of low checking rate and accuracy of single classifier detection as well as instability of single classifier detection.",

In this paper, we reviewed the published studies in the past years that investigated possible effects of CTCT in the treatment of common psychiatric symptoms and disorders. In summary, the current literature provided relatively ample evidence that CTCT can help to reduce depressive symptoms in both clinical and non-clinical Chinese populations. A relatively large number of studies also supported the opinion that CTCT can help to relieve anxiety in participants with anxiety disorders. Some other studies also suggested that insomnia, cognitive impairment, and alcohol dependence can be treated by CTCT; however, such conclusions might be considered as exploratory before they are repeated. Further studies can be conducted in larger sample sizes to provide more solid evidence, and in participants with other psychiatric symptoms/disorders that have not been investigated.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy with potential adverse effects on fetal development. Although short-term outcomes are relatively well-documented, long-term health consequences in offspring remain poorly understood.\nObjective: To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize evidence on the long-term health outcomes of children born to mothers with HG.\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched up to March 2025. Studies reporting any long-term physical, cognitive, metabolic, or neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring of HG pregnancies were included. Data were pooled using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic.\nResults: Eleven studies comprising 1,024,385 participants met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that HG was significantly associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11–1.63), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09–1.42), and autism spectrum disorders (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.20–1.72). No significant associations were found with metabolic or growth-related outcomes.\nConclusions: Offspring of mothers with HG are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairments. Clinicians should be aware of these risks and consider long-term developmental follow-up for affected children.",

Detecting them early is crucial for improving system reliability. While machine learning has been used for code smell detection, most studies focused on Java, with limited research on other languages. In this study, we empirically investigated the effectiveness of both deep learning and heterogeneous ensemble models in detecting multiple Python code smells, including Large Class, Long Method, Long Scope Chaining, Long Parameter List and Long Base Class List. We evaluated three heterogeneous ensemble models: Stacking, Hard Voting and Soft Voting ensembles, alongside three deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units. Each ensemble was built using eight base models, and the Wilcoxon test was used to assess performance differences. Results indicated that Stacking consistently outperformed other models with superior stability and detection performance. Convolutional Neural Networks performed well in some smells but struggled with complex nested structures, where ensemble models offered more stability. Hard and Soft Voting ensembles were competitive but less stable than Stacking. These findings highlight the potential of ensemble and deep learning models in enhancing Python code smell detection.",

Behind the scenes, however, spam is a real pain for both companies and people. It wastes money, clogs inboxes,\nand more dangerously can slip in phishing attempts or malware. Researchers have tried everything from simple keyword filters\nto some rather sophisticated artificial intelligence over the years in an attempt to fight it. The truth is, though, spammers are\nsmart. Your filter's degree of predictability will determine how quickly they can evade it. This study helps with this. Rather than\ndepending only on one type of model, such as a CNN or a simple LSTM, we chose to vary things and produce a hybrid deep\nlearning system. CNNs are excellent at identifying small patterns in text, BiLSTMs help understand the whole context of a\nmessage (what came before and after), and then, just for that extra punch, we brought in Reinforcement Learning to let the\nmodel actually learn from its own mistakes over time. Think of it like assembling a team where each player brings a special\nability. Still, we did not stop there, not even near. In the last section of this work and this is the bit I'm most proud of we\ndeveloped a custom reward-based attention mechanism that changes which parts of an email receive more focus based on\nwhether the model obtained the previous predictions right or wrong. It's sort of like teaching the model to \"pay more attention\nnext time,\" based on past behavior: a bit like how we humans learn following a mistake. I built everything to run on Google\nColab with live demos, tested the model on a mix of standard and hybrid datasets, and ensured the architecture is lightweight\nenough for practical use. So the outcome is Not only does this system know how to adapt but it also catches spam better than\nmany current systems. And that might just be the secret to remain ahead in a world where spam keeps changing its strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Wheat plays a critical role in ensuring food security across Asia, where increasing demand, resource limitations, and climate change pose significant challenges to the sustainability of production. Long-term field experiments (LTEs), characterized by decades of continuous observation, provide essential evidence regarding the impacts of agronomic practices on productivity, soil health, climate resilience, and resource efficiency. This review synthesizes findings from LTEs conducted in Asia and worldwide to evaluate the sustainability of wheat-based systems. Yield trends observed in Long-term field experiments highlight the advantages of crop rotation, conservation practices, and integrated nutrient management in stabilizing productivity. Although continuous wheat cultivation can lead to soil degradation, practices such as organic amendments and optimized nitrogen management have been shown to enhance soil fertility and nutrient use efficiency. Water management, particularly in water-scarce regions, remains a critical concern; strategies such as mulching, root architecture optimization, and the balance of nitrogen and phosphorus offer measurable improvements in water use efficiency. Additionally, Long-term field experiments illuminate potential pathways for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through reduced reliance on synthetic inputs and the adoption of conservation agriculture techniques. Despite these advancements, significant knowledge gaps persist concerning the socio-economic scalability of these practices, interactions among genotype, environment, and management, and the effectiveness of institutional support systems. This review identifies priorities for future LTEs, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary approaches, long-term climate risk monitoring, and innovations in data management. Furthermore, policy support is crucial for institutionalizing LTE networks, enhancing farmer engagement, and mainstreaming sustainable wheat cultivation. The findings underscore the indispensable role of Long-term field experiments in developing resilient wheat systems that align with food security and environmental objectives in Asia.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the vital physiological signals for human health. Lightweight neural network (NN) models integrated into a low-resource wearable device can benefit the user with a low-power, real-time edge computing system for continuous and daily monitoring. This work introduces a novel edge-computing wearable device for real-time beat-by-beat ECG arrhythmia classification. The proposed wearable integrates the light AI model into a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-based custom printed circuit board (PCB). The work analyzes the performance of artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models for real-time wearable implementation. The wearable is capable of real-time QRS detection and feature extraction from raw ECG data. The QRS detection algorithm offers high reliability with a 99.5% F1 score and R-peak position error (RPE) of 6.3 ms for R-peak-to-R-peak intervals. The proposed method implements a combination of top time series, spectral, and signal-specific features for model development. Lightweight, pretrained models are deployed on the custom wearable and evaluated in real time using mock data from the MIT-BIH dataset. We propose an LSTM model that provides efficient performance over accuracy, inference latency, and memory consumption. The proposed model offers 98.1% accuracy, with 98.2% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity while testing in real time on the wearable. Real-time inferencing takes 20 ms, and the device consumes as low as 5.9 mA of power. The proposed method achieves efficient performance in real-time testing, which indicates the wearable can be effectively used for real-time continuous arrhythmia detection.",

    "abstract": "Skin diseases continue to be one of the most widely diagnosed medical concerns globally, affecting both developed and\ndeveloping regions at scale. These dermatological conditions, which range from fungal infections and viral lesions to chronic\nautoimmune disorders, demand timely and precise identification to ensure effective treatment. Unfortunately, diagnosis often\nhinges on access to skilled dermatologists and clinical resources, both of which may be limited in rural or underserved areas.\nManual diagnosis is not only time-consuming but prone to errors due to visual overlap across diseases.\nTo address this challenge, our research presents a robust deep learning-based classification system that uses Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect a wide range of skin diseases from image data. We compiled a diverse and highresolution custom dataset consisting of over 8,000 annotated images covering various dermatological conditions including\nChickenpox, Shingles, Psoriasis, Nail Fungus, Cutaneous Larvae Migrans, Impetigo, and several others. We trained a\nResNet50-based model, which leveraged transfer learning and advanced preprocessing strategies to enhance classification\nperformance. Our model attained over 92% accuracy, demonstrating high generalization capability. In this paper, we explore the\ndataset preparation process, CNN design, training methodology, and evaluation metrics in-depth. Furthermore, we integrate\nstate-of-the-art explainability techniques and discuss practical deployment strategies to ensure real-world applicability.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Although the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) is now quite widespread, exhaustive evidence on its long-term efficacy is still lacking in high risk and locally advanced disease. We aimed to evaluate long-term cancer control outcomes in pathologically high risk and locally advanced PCa treated with RALP at a single tertiary referral center. Methods: Patients with pathologically high risk PCa (pT ≥3a, pN0-1 or GG ≥4) who underwent RALP between 2001 and 2022 were selected from our institutional database. Patients with metastatic PCa (M1) were excluded from the analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate All-cause mortality free-survival (ACM-FS) and Additional Treatment free-survival (ATFS). The probability of cancer-specific mortality free-survival (CSM-free survival) was estimated with the competing risks method. Competing risk regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of CSM, while Cox regression models tested the predictors of both ACM and AT after surgery. Results: Our final cohort consisted of 803 patients who underwent RALP for high risk PCa with a median age and median follow-up time were 64 years and 72 respectively. Of all, 670 (84%), 798 (99%) and 323 (40%) had GG 4-5 PCa, pT≥3a PCa and pN1 PCa, respectively. Overall, 393 (48.5%) and 203 (25%) had positive surgical margins (PSM) and PSA persistence, respectively. Among the patients with adequate information about AT after surgery (n=635), 416 (65.5%) patients actually received AT. Specifically, 46 (11%), 110 (26%) and 260 (63%) underwent RT only, HT only and RT plus HT, respectively. Within follow-up, 140 deaths occurred, of which 69 were due to PCa. At 20-years of follow-up, CSM-FS and ACM-FS were 72.6% (56.8%-86.5%) and 45.1% (29.0%-59.9%), respectively. With a median ATFS time of 2.3 years, the 10 and 15-year rates of ATFS were 26.3% (22.0%-30.9%) and 17.1% (12.5%-22.3%), respectively. Among the pathological variables included in the multivariable regression models, pT3b stage was found to be an independent predictor of all adverse oncological outcomes (CSM, ATM, AT) we explored. Conclusions: Patients with pathologically high-risk or locally advanced PCa treated with RALP seem to achieve durable long-term oncological control. Our report provides the longest follow-up after RALP for truly aggressive forms of PCa, making it a valuable resource for counselling patients on the long-term oncologic outcomes of this procedure.",

Aging individuals are generally weaker, less stable, and slower to react, increasing the likelihood of falls and injuries. Falls are a serious concern, have a significant impact on mobility and quality of life. They also have a significant financial impact on healthcare systems worldwide. The effects of a fall can range from minor bruises, injuries, life-threatening fractures and even fatal conditions. For these reasons, continuous monitoring of the activities of elderly and disabled people has become one of the main goals of telemedicine, and wearable devices have become widespread. The main goal of this study is to develop a system that allows for the precise and automatic detection and monitoring of falls. This approach will generate timely alerts and notifications to quickly inform caregivers or medical doctors. The system created in the study is expandable and can add a large number of sensors. The data transferred from the IMU sensors placed on the patient to the Raspberry Pi is evaluated by software. A fall perception is created when sudden changes occur from the values determined as normal posture levels. Bending and falling are separated. Taking this into account, various falling variations are detected.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSpecific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold significant clinical potential for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic agents. However, this field remains underutilized due to the lack of straightforward and versatile techniques for isolating EV subpopulations from biofluids. Here, we present LODGE, a long DNA probe‐guided EV entanglement strategy for the simple, rapid, and selective enrichment of tumor‐derived EVs (tEVs) from clinical specimens. LODGE uses two long DNA affinity probes to recognize specific subpopulations, causing them to aggregate with the assistance of splint strands, thereby achieving nondestructive, high‐yield, and high‐purity separation of tEVs within a short period. Proteomic analysis revealed that the isolated tEVs contributed to the identification of tumor‐associated biomarkers compared to total EVs. Additionally, by incorporating a split G‐quadruplex‐containing molecular trap domain, a novel structure that significantly improves the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T (ThT), into DNA affinity probes, we developed an innovative LODGE‐ThT sensing strategy for the highly sensitive profiling of multiple tEV subpopulations. Using data from the tEVs alongside clinical indicators processed with machine learning algorithms, we effectively classified five tumor types. Our results show that LODGE is a promising tool for identifying specific EV subpopulations, and fostering their biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Ethiopia is home to a diverse group of ixodid ticks that are known to transmit disease to both animals and humans. Recent advances in metagenome sequencing show there is more microorganism diversity found in ticks than previously known. Compared to amplicon-based gene identification methods, agnostic metagenomic sequencing provides broader insights into the diversity of microorganisms in ticks, providing knowledge that will better enable public health measures in preventing the spread of zoonotic disease. In the present study, metagenomic sequencing was used to look at the microbial diversity of ticks collected from livestock in Ethiopia. This study identified six bacterial genera (Coxiella, Francisella, spotted-fever group (SFG) Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Ehrlichia, and Borrelia), one genus of eukaryotic parasite (Babesia sp.), and one virus species (Parapoxvirus bovinestomatitis) from 154 tick pools representing 22 species of ticks among four genera (Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, and Rhipicephalus). We were able to differentiate between pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms, highlighting concerns among traditional gene-targeted screening methods. Among all pooled samples, the predominant microorganisms included Coxiella-like endosymbionts (55.2%), SFG Rickettsia (38.3%), and nonpathogenic Francisella spp. (26.0%). Rickettsia africae was the predominant pathogenic agent detected, and phylogenetic analysis of two samples from A. gemma and A. variegatum confirmed the presence of R. africae. This study highlights the power of metagenomics applied to potential vectors of zoonotic disease, and it expands the knowledge on tick-pathogen associations in Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "In an era of growing digital interconnectedness, the threat landscape for networked systems has expanded rapidly, making traditional security mechanisms increasingly ineffective against sophisticated cyber-attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in identifying and mitigating such threats, but conventional rule-based approaches often fail to detect novel or evolving attack patterns. This paper proposes an AI-powered IDS framework that utilizes Random Forest and Decision Tree machine learning models for high-accuracy threat detection in real time. The models are trained on benchmark datasets, namely NSL-KDD and CICDDOS2019, both widely used in cybersecurity research. Preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding and robust feature scaling were applied to optimize learning. The trained models are then integrated into a web application built with Flask, providing users with a seamless interface to upload network traffic logs in CSV format and instantly receive predictions. The system also incorporates rule-based logic to categorize detected attacks into DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R, enhancing interpretability. Evaluation results demonstrate that the Random Forest model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.36% and an F1-score of 0.9986, outperforming the Decision Tree model across all metrics. The application supports real-time traffic classification, returning predictions within seconds and displaying confusion matrices, precision, recall, and attack distributions through a clean, responsive UI. This research bridges the gap between theoretical machine learning models and their real-world application in cybersecurity, offering a scalable, accurate, and user-friendly solution for automated threat detection in both academic and professional environments.",

    "abstract": "The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused catastrophic damage in Aceh-Indonesia, leaving profound psychological impacts on survivors. This study examines the long-term role of problem-focused coping in predicting post-traumatic growth (PTG) among 145 adult survivors who lost close family members. Using the Post-Traumatic Growth Scale and the Problem-Focused Coping Scale, the results show that problem-focused coping significantly predicts PTG, accounting for 52.34% of the variance (p &lt; 0.001). Survivors who employed active, constructive coping strategies displayed greater growth, meaning-making, and personal development nearly two decades after the trauma. These findings underscore the enduring significance of adaptive coping and the importance of incorporating culturally grounded values into post-disaster mental health interventions.",

    "abstract": "Malware continues to evolve in complexity, often evading traditional detection methods through obfuscation, polymorphism, and zero-day exploits. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Hybrid Malware Detection Framework that integrates signature-based detection, static analysis, dynamic behavioural monitoring, and ensemble machine learning. The framework extracts both static features such as metadata and API imports, and dynamic behaviour patterns like file system activity, process creation, and network access, which are processed into a unified vector for classification. Ensemble models, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost, are employed for robust and adaptive threat identification. Evaluation on a balanced dataset of benign and malicious samples demonstrated a detection accuracy of up to 98.6%, significantly outperforming single-method approaches. The system also features a Decision Engine for result fusion and a Feedback Module to support model retraining and explainability. These results highlight the effectiveness of hybrid analysis in enhancing detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and improving resilience against modern malware threats.",

    "issuedDate": "2025-6-30",
    "abstract": "Introduction/BackgroundCompromised bone and muscle health is a significant concern for children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP) and other non-progressive neuromotor impairments. Weak bones increase the incidence of fragility fractures and predispose individuals to lifelong problems, such as osteoporosis. ObjectivesThis study quantified bone and muscle health in children and adolescents with CP and other neuromotor impairments across all five gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels.MethodsPeripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scans of both tibiae were acquired at the 3%, 38%, and 66% of tibia length in 22 children and adolescents (4–17 years old) diagnosed with CP and “CP-like” neurodevelopmental conditions causing motor impairment. Age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched Z-scores were generated in reference to a normative typically developing population for total bone mineral content (BMC), trabecular and cortical bone mineral density (Tb.BMD, Ct.BMD), cortical BMC (Ct.BMC), cortical area (Ct.Ar), cortical thickness (Ct.Th), periosteal and endosteal circumference, cortical section modulus (Z), and muscle cross-sectional area (MCSA).ResultsTibial total BMC, Tb.BMD, Ct.BMC, Ct.Th, Ct.Ar, periosteal circumference, Z, and MCSA were significantly lower in children with CP and CP-like conditions compared to typically developing peers (median Z-scores ranged from -2.66 to -1.09; p = 0.019 to &amp;lt;0.001) and showed greater deficits in children and adolescents with lower levels of motor function than those with higher functional abilities (GMFCS I-II vs III-V; p = 0.042 to &amp;lt;0.001). Endosteal circumference was not different from zero (p = 0.756) but was smaller in children and adolescents with lower levels of motor function (p = 0.042). Ct.BMD did not differ compared to typically developing youth (p = 0.202) or between functional abilities (p = 0.168). ConclusionsResults reveal that bone and muscle size, total and cortical content, and trabecular density are impaired in children with CP and CP-like conditions; however, cortical mineralization is not impaired. Therefore, the heightened risk of fragility fractures in children and adolescents with CP and CP-like conditions is likely due to smaller and thinner bone structure. Future investigation into bone microarchitecture is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The correlations between event-by-event fluctuations of symmetry planes are measured in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair sNN=5.02TeV recorded by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This analysis is conducted using the Gaussian estimator technique, which is insensitive to biases from correlations between different flow amplitudes. The study presents, for the first time, the centrality dependence of correlations involving up to five different symmetry planes. The correlation strength varies depending on the harmonic order of the symmetry plane and the collision centrality. Comparisons with measurements from lower energies indicate no significant differences within uncertainties. Additionally, the results are compared with hydrodynamic model calculations. Although the model predictions provide a qualitative explanation of the experimental results, they overestimate the data for some observables. This is particularly true for correlators that are sensitive to the nonlinear response of the medium to initial-state anisotropies in the collision system. As these new correlators provide unique information—independent of flow amplitudes—their usage in future model developments can further constrain the properties of the strongly interacting matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n          \n            \n            \n              \n                ©2025 CERN, for the ALICE Collaboration\n                2025\n                CERN",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The current study underscores the potential role of miRNAs, specifically miR-3173 and miR-155, as promising biomarkers for breast and ovarian cancers (BC and OC). The primary objective was to evaluate the expression levels of these miRNAs in cancer patients compared to healthy individuals, assess their diagnostic accuracy, and explore their associations with cancer progression and prognosis. Methods: This study involved 60 participants, comprising 30 patients diagnosed with primary BC and 30 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Tumor tissue samples were obtained from all patients for molecular analysis. For control comparisons, adjacent non-tumorous tissues from both groups were utilized. miR-3173 and miR-155 expression levels were measured using real-time PCR (qPCR). The diagnostic accuracy of both miRNAs was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calculating sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing cancer cases from healthy controls. Additionally, the association of miR-155 with metastasis was explored, and miR-3173’s correlation with poor progression-free survival in BC patients was assessed using Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis. Results: Both miRNAs were found to be significantly upregulated in cancer patients compared to healthy individuals, with miR-155 exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing BC and OC cases. Notably, miR-155 is associated with metastasis, which aligns with previous research, suggesting its role as an oncogene in epithelial OC. Meanwhile, the elevated expression of miR-3173 correlates with poor progression-free survival in BC patients, marking it as a potential prognostic marker. However, these results highlight the complexity of miRNA expression in cancer progression, as miR-3173 showed varied associations with different types of cancer. Despite these challenges, the ROC curve analysis for both miRNAs is promising with high sensitivity and specificity for both BC and OC. Conclusion: The study findings are particularly significant in the context of early diagnosis and monitoring cancer progression, yet further investigations involving larger cohorts and diverse populations are needed to validate these results. Future studies should focus on expanding sample sizes, refining the understanding of miRNA roles in tumor progression, and exploring their potential as therapeutic targets. These advancements could significantly enhance personalized treatment strategies for breast and ovarian cancer, improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health challenge in Nigeria, particularly among nomadic pastoralist populations who face barriers such as geographical isolation, cultural differences, and mobility. These factors contribute to low case detection and poor treatment outcomes. This study evaluated a community-based, culturally adapted intervention aimed at improving TB case detection, treatment adherence, and community empowerment in Adamawa State, Nigeria.\nMethods: A mixed-methods approach was employed across three LGAs from July 2023 to December 2024. Quantitative data from routine health records assessed changes in case notifications and treatment outcomes; qualitative data from focus groups and interviews explored community perceptions and barriers. The intervention included culturally tailored education, training of pastoralist TB champions, and empowerment activities fostering local ownership.\nResults: The intervention resulted in a 72% increase in TB case notifications (from 22% to 38%; p&lt;0.01) and improved treatment success to 94% (from 86%; p&lt;0.05). Qualitative findings indicated high levels of accurate TB knowledge (78%), reduced stigma, and increased community ownership. Community volunteers played a pivotal role in bridging access gaps and fostering trust.\nConclusions: Community engagement and empowerment strategies significantly improved TB detection and treatment among nomadic pastoralists. Scaling such approaches could be vital in Nigeria’s efforts to address TB among marginalized populations.",

This paper presents HawkPhish-DNN cybersecurity model, a novel phishing detection framework that integrates Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) with a Deep Neural Network (DNN). In the preprocessing phase, redundant URLs and domain features are removed, while URL length and entropy are extracted to form an efficient feature set. The detection model employs advanced neural layers, including Sigmoid and ReLU, to enhance learning and classification. By leveraging multi-objective HHO, HawkPhish-DNN optimizes accuracy and mitigates false positives through a time-varying penalty function, Pareto dominance, and crowding distance strategies. Empirical findings demonstrate that HawkPhish-DNN cybersecurity model achieves an accuracy of up to 99.6% and a false positive rate as low as 0.2% on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it maintains low computational overhead, ensuring practicality for real-time deployment. These results highlight the potential of HawkPhish-DNN cybersecurity model in providing a robust, user-friendly defense against phishing threats without inflating false alarms.",

    "abstract": "The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) has fueled discoveries of common and rare genetic variation contributing to liability to many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. This narrative review reflects on major findings from the past half decade of research by this international group of investigators in five priority areas: discovery of common variants using GWAS; rare variation and its interplay with polygenic risk; leveraging genetics to go beyond diagnostic boundaries; ascribing functional attributes to genomic discoveries; and developing and implementing processes for data sharing, outreach to various communities, and training. The insights gained in these domains frame the agenda for the next phase of PGC research. In addition to accelerating integrative common and rare variant-, within- and across-disorder findings for multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, the next phase will leverage multiple populations to further elucidate genetic etiologies, integrate results with rapidly accumulating multi-modal functional genomics data to gain mechanistic understanding, bring genetic findings to clinically actionable phenotypes such as treatment response, and address the emerging use of polygenic scores. Taken together, these next steps will illuminate the biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders, which continue to contribute to global morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "The detection of drug interactions remains a critical challenge in clinical practice, with potential consequences ranging from therapeutic failure to severe adverse events. This study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT in identifying drug interactions compared to established clinical tools, including Medscape, Lexicomp, and Drugs.com. Using a dataset of 250 commonly prescribed medication combinations, we assessed accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and response comprehensiveness across platforms. ChatGPT demonstrated 78.6% overall accuracy, compared to 94.2% for Lexicomp, 91.8% for Medscape, and 89.4% for Drugs.com. While ChatGPT excelled in providing comprehensive explanations of interaction mechanisms (mean score 4.2/5 versus 3.8/5 for traditional tools), it exhibited lower sensitivity in detecting critical interactions (76.3% versus 93.7% for established tools) and higher false favorable rates for certain drug classes. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT shows promise as a supplementary tool, particularly for generating patient-friendly explanations, it currently lacks the reliability necessary for standalone use in clinical decision-making. This research highlights the potential and limitations of large language models in drug interaction screening and emphasizes the need for continuous validation and refinement before implementation in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Background: Postpartum hemorrhage is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Shock Index (SI), defined as heart rate (HR) divided by systolic blood pressure (SBP), is emerging as a valuable early predictor of hemodynamic instability.\n\nObjective: This study evaluates the role of SI in predicting adverse maternal outcomes, including need for ICU admission, need forblood transfusion, and surgical intervention.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from March 2023 to March 2024 at Dr.B.R.A.M Hospital, Raipur, involving 65 patients diagnosed with PPH. SI was measured at 15-minute intervals for 1 hour post-delivery. The primary outcomes included need for ICU admission, need for blood transfusion, and surgical intervention.\n\nResults: SI&gt;1.1 was significantly associated with increased ICU admissions (40%), need for massive transfusion (68%), and surgical interventions (55%). ROC curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, indicating strong predictive value of SI.\n\nConclusion: SI is an effective tool for early detection of hemodynamic instability in PPH and should be integrated into obstetric early warning systems for better maternal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Matrix factorization (MF) technique has been widely utilized in recommendation systems due to the precise prediction of users’ interests. Prior MF-based methods adapt the overall rating to make the recommendation by extracting latent factors from users and items. However, in real applications, people’s preferences usually vary with time; the traditional MF-based methods could not properly capture the change of users’ interests. In this paper, by incorporating the recurrent neural network (RNN) into MF, we developed a novel recommendation system, M-RNN-F, to effectively describe the preference evolution of users over time. A learning model is proposed to capture the evolution pattern and predict the user preference in the future. The experimental results show that M-RNN-F performs better than other state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. In addition, we conduct experiments on real world dataset to demonstrate the practicability.",

    "abstract": "AbstractVarious ions in the brain (e.g., H+, K+, and Ca2+) play essential roles in neural information transmission and physiopathological processes. Real‐time monitoring of these ions will provide critical information for understanding neural functions and diagnosing diseases. However, long‐term monitoring the dynamics of ions with microelectrodes remains a challenge due to the limited availability of sensing strategies capable of in vivo measurements with high stability in the mechanically soft and chemically complex brain of freely moving rats. Here, we develop a flexible and stable ion‐selective microsensor for long‐term monitoring of ions in rat brain, in which zeolite imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) nanoparticles incorporated with ionophores are used for selective ion recognition and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers sputtered with gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as the soft electrode substrate. The flexible microsensors allow long‐term in vivo ion sensing with good stability in the brain of behaving rat, avoiding progressively deteriorating response of traditional polymer‐based rigid ion selective microsensor caused by its instability interface and mechanical mismatch to soft brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               We present a new suite of edge (‘Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation’s Edge’) cosmological zoom simulations. The suite includes 15 radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxies covering the ultra-faint to the dwarf irregular regime (104 ≤ M⋆(z = 0) ≤ 108 M⊙) to enable comparisons with observed scaling relations. Each object in the suite is evolved at high resolution (≈3 pc) and includes stellar radiation, winds and supernova feedback channels. We compare with previous edge simulations without radiation, finding that radiative feedback results in significantly weaker galactic outflows. This generalises our previous findings to a wide mass range, and reveals that the effect is most significant at low M⋆. Despite this difference, stellar masses stay within a factor of two of each other, and key scaling relations of dwarf galaxies (size-mass, neutral gas-stellar mass, gas-phase mass-metallicity) emerge correctly in both simulation suites. Only the stellar mass – stellar metallicity relation is strongly sensitive to the change in feedback. This highlights how obtaining statistical samples of dwarf galaxy stellar abundances with next-generation spectrographs will be key to probing and constraining the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to determine the short and long-term effects of seafood production variables, including capture fisheries production, aquaculture production and trade in the fisheries sector on Indonesia's economic growth. This is necessary because seafood products have great benefits, especially in fulfilling the nutritional needs for the population. This research was based on the time series data of uses an explanatory quantitative approach with the vector error correction model (VECM) analysis technique. The data used in this study is secondary data obtained from BPS, World Bank, FAO, and OECD. Through the Johansen Cointegration Test in the VECM analysis technique, it is shown the long-term and short-term effects of seafood production variables on Indonesia's economic growth. The results showed that the variable capture fisheries production and aquaculture production had short-term and long-term effects on Indonesia's economic growth. However, the international trade variable in the fisheries sector only has a short-term effect on Indonesia's economic growth. Government needs to increase expenditure to build better infrastructure and fishing technology can be achieved through better facilities and greater financial support for Indonesian fishermen to improve the fishing industry. Recommendations for improvements in these areas have been made.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of the Read–Answer–Discuss–Explain–Create (RADEC) model, integrated with English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI), in reducing science learning anxiety among secondary school students. The research addresses a common challenge faced by non-native English speakers in science classrooms—language-induced anxiety that hinders conceptual understanding and communication. Employing a convergent mixed-methods design, the study involved 30 secondary students purposively selected from Bandung, Indonesia. Quantitative data were collected through a time-series experiment, while qualitative insights were obtained via in-depth interviews. After five months of implementing the RADEC model with EMI, students exhibited marked reductions in communication apprehension, fear of negative evaluation, and test anxiety. At the same time, they demonstrated enhanced conceptual mastery and confidence in English-mediated scientific communication. The findings suggest that the RADEC model with EMI provides a structured yet flexible pedagogical framework, enabling pupils to access, discuss, and present scientific content in English without fear of linguistic penalties. The novelty of this study lies in its integration of a culturally responsive pedagogical model (RADEC) with EMI to address both cognitive and affective barriers in science education. This approach offers scalable potential for EMI-based instruction in multilingual, cross-national educational contexts.",
